# Platon_pipeline_run
# üåç PLATON Exoplanet Atmosphere Pipeline (Custom Offline Setup)

This repository contains a fully working version of the PLATON atmospheric modeling tool modified to run with a local dataset ‚Äî useful for systems with limited internet or reproducibility needs.

## üîß What‚Äôs Included

- Patched PLATON core (`_get_data.py`) to avoid re-downloading 10GB datasets.
- Scripts for transit depth calculation, eclipse modeling, and surface emission.
- Visualizer example to render transit views of exoplanets.
- Output plots and retrieval results.
- Local path configuration for Mac M1 compatibility.
